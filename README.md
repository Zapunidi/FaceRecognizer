# FaceRecognizer
My final project of "Neural Networks" course at MSU faculty of physics.

A simple face recognition system based on FaceNet architecture.

You may use main.py to launch the application from the console, or use Face recognition.ipynb to launch it in Jupyter Notebook.

When launching from the console, you may use --video_source argument to specify path to video you want to use. If you want to use your webcam, just launch the main.py.
